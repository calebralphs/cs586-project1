# Big Data Analytics Project 1

Yelp has become enormously popular as a way to share ratings and reviews for restaurants throughout many parts of the world. Presently, there are millions of users, restaurants, and reviews that have been generated by food enthusiasts everywhere. Yelp has provided a subset of this vast amount of data for exploratory work, and we have decided to use the opportunity to develop a better rating system from this data. Our target is improving on the rating system for restaurant reviews to get a more accurate and informative result.
